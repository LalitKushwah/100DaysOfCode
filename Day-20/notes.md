# Sizes & Units

## There are following units available in css:
    - px
    - %
    - rem
    - em
    - vh
    - vw
## 3 Rules to remember while using units (containing blocks)
    - if the target element has position fixed then unit will be calcuated against `viewport`
    - if the target element has position absolute and unit will be calculated against `ancestor's content + padding`
    - if the target element has position static/relative then unit will be calculated against `ancestor's content having display as block`

# Miscellaneous
    - font-size, margin, padding should always be in rem unit
    - while centring elements keep margin auto
