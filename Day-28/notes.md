# Directive for adding conditions
    - `v-if` is just like if statement of js you can pass condition in value
    - `v-show` is alternative of `v-if` but it just adds `display:none` to the element instead of removing it from DOM
    - :key should be used with v-for for identification of each element it helps in DOM manipulation
