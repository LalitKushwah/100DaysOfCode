# Stacking Context
    - Stacking contexts can be contained in other stacking contexts, and together create a hierarchy of stacking contexts.
    - Each stacking context is completely independent of its siblings: only descendant elements are considered when stacking is processed.
    - Each stacking context is self-contained: after the element's contents are stacked, the whole element is considered in the stacking order of the parent stacking context.
