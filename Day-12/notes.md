 # Today I have designed my organization's section along with this I had a discussion while coding with my wife regarding HTTP method types (I know its note related to HTML but keeping it as a record)
 
 - outline is not part of box-model
 - Idempotancy Operation done in repeated manner doesn't affect the output
 - Patch http method type is used for partially updating the resource
