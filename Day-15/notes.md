# Position Property
position property helps you to set the position of html element in view.It has follwing values:
    - absolute
    - fixed
    - relative
    - sticky
    - static (default)

## fixed
When you set position property then it takes position from the viewport which means if you set position fixed with top: 0 then your element will be sticked to the viewport

# Miscellaneous
    - z-index on element doesn't work untill we apply position property
    - default value of z-index is auto (0)
